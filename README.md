# Staging caries around restorations in bitewing radiographs

This is the code repository accompanying the paper *"Niels van Nistelrooij, Eduardo Chaves, et al., 2024. Deep learning-based algorithm for staging caries around restorations in bitewings"* submitted to Caries Research.


## Installation

Please refer to `setup.sh` for the installation of a virtual environment and the necessary packages.


## Reproduction

### Pre-processing

With the bitewing radiographs and annotations from multiple annotators as supplied on OSF, the data can be pre-processed and split for 10-fold cross-validation by running

``` shell
PYTHONPATH=code python code/caries/preprocess.py
```

### Two-stage training

The algorithm for detecting and staging caries lesions around restorations uses a two-stage training approach. The first stage detects teeth, restorations, residual caries lesions, and primary/secondary caries lesions. The second stage detects primary and secondary caries lesions and predicts a lesion severity score from 0 to 1.

#### Stage 1

Specify the cross-validation split you would like to train within `caries/configs/stage1.py` and run the following in the terminal:

``` shell
PYTHONPATH=code python code/mmdetection/tools/train.py code/caries/configs/stage1.py
```

While training is running, several metrics are logged to TensorBoard in the working directory specified by `work_dir` in the configuration file.

#### Stage 2

Likewise, specify the cross-validation split you would like within `caries/configs/stage2.py` after training the first stage for that split and run the following in the terminal:

``` shell
PYTHONPATH=code python code/mmdetection/tools/train.py code/caries/configs/stage2.py
```

The model parameters will be initialized based on the stage 1 model to fine-tune the effectiveness for detecting and staging primary and secondary caries lesions.


### Inference

Choose the latest or best checkpoint from the working directory and run the following to save the annotations and predictions to a pickle file in the working directory.

```shell
PYTHONPATH=code python code/mmdetection/tools/test.py code/caries/configs/stage2.py work_dirs/stage2_<split>/<checkpoint>.pth --tta [--show [--wait-time <seconds>]] 
```

### Evaluation

The annotations can be compared to the predictions visually, by specifying `--show` and `--wait-time` after the inference terminal command above.

Additionally, confusion matrices and ROC curves can be made by running `caries/evaluation/tooth_level.py`. Furthermore, the predictions of lesion severity scores can be evaluated by running `caries/evaluations/lesion_level.py`.
